# Real-time abnormal human's motion behavior detection 
In the project, a deep learning method and a GMM-based motion detection algorithm are developed for detecting abnormal behavior.
The trained models are evaluated using accuracy and confusion chart, and two user-friendly GUIs are implemented 
for offline and real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Description

In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of surveillance cameras in public places 
such as parks, airports and shopping malls in order to enhance public safety and social security. 
Despite this, many public places still rely on traditional surveillance techniques such as offline 
video analysis or manual monitoring to identify unusual behaviour. Given the exponential 
growth in surveillance video data, these traditional methods have become increasingly complex 
and challenging, preventing security personnel from detecting unusual events in a timely 
manner. In addition, abnormal events typically occur far less frequently than typical activities, 
resulting in a significant waste of manpower and time. There is therefore an urgent need to 
develop an intelligent surveillance system that can analyses human behavior in real time, 
automatically alert and preserve evidence related to abnormal behavior. In addition, motion 
detection can accurately locate the position of moving individuals in video, simplifying the 
process for users to identify areas of interest when reviewing recorded alarm scenes or 
observing live footage. This ultimately improves the efficiency and accuracy of abnormal 
activity detection
